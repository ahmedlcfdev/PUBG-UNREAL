<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Hello everyone, this is an ongoing project I’m working on using UE4’s Blueprint visual scripting feature. The game is a close replica of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), which is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation. Please note that the current version of the game does not support multiplayer yet. 

In this game, you get to control the character using your keyboard and mouse. The Character has three main positions - stand, crouch and prone. You can move around in all three positions. Pressing down Shift/ Ctrl while you move will increase/decrease your character’s speed. In addition, the character can also interact with items she picks up from the ground; the character can equip a vest and helmet for extra protection, and a backpack for extra item storage capacity; she is also able to hold/switch/fire weapons with realistic shaking and recoil effects. The game also has a basic UI interface that allows for the player to drag and drop pieces of equipment from the ground to her backpack/body. Since there isn’t a built-in options menu that allows you to change the keyboard input in the game yet, here are all the inputs I used during development. 



Move Mouse - Look Around  <br />
W - Move Forward  <br />
A - Move Left  <br />
S - Move Backward  <br />
D - Move Right  <br />
Space - Jump  <br />
C - Crouch  <br />
Z - Prone <br />
Left Ctrl - Walk <br />
Left Shift - Run <br />
G - Discard Current Weapon <br />
Click Right Mouse Button - Open Sight <br />
Hold Right Mouse Button - Normal Aim <br />
Left Mouse Button - Fire Gun <br />
B - Change Shoot Mode (Single Or Auto) <br />
R - Reload <br />
X - Take Back Current Weapon <br />
Tab - Show Inventory <br />
1 - Equip Left Weapon <br />
2 - Equip Right Weapon <br />
F - Interact With Item <br />
Hold Left Alt - Look Around Player <br />
M - Toggle Map [Not Yet added] <br />

### System Requirement
UE4 It is developed by the Epic Games and is considered one of the most open and advanced real-time 3D creation tools. The Minimum System requirement for running UE4 is listed below: 
<br /><br />
Desktop running on Microsoft Windows or MAC <br /><br />
The operating system needs to be Windows 7 64-bit or Mac OS X 10.9.2 or the latest. <br /><br />
The processor is one of the most vital parts of the system, which impacts the performance of the system. The minimum requirement of the processor needs to be Quad-core Intel or AMD processor of 2.5 GHz or faster.<br /><br />
The Graphics card needs to be NVIDIA GeForce 470 GTX or AMD Radeon 6870 HD series card or higher. With a higher amount of VRAM, your workstation will be able to display your content even in 4K, and the extra power will be good for games.<br /> <br />
You can run Unreal Engine 4 on 4GB RAM but it might slow if you have many applications running in the background. To run it smoothly, 8GB RAM is recommended.<br /><br />
